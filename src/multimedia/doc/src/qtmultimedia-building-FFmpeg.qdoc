\title Building FFmpeg from source
\brief This document describes how to build FFmpeg from source code.

This page describes the process of configuring and building \l{FFmpeg} on
supported platforms.

You may need to build FFmpeg when:

\list
\li You need a custom configuration or static build of FFmpeg.
\li FFmpeg builds available online are not suitable for your product.
\li FFmpeg needs to be updated on an existing product between Qt releases.
\endlist

In these guides, we describe how to build FFmpeg with the same feature support
as the FFmpeg binaries that are bundled with the Qt Online Installer. FFmpeg has
a wide variety of configuration options to tune the FFmpeg library size,
performance, and feature support. To read more about these options, see the
\l{https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide}{FFmpeg Compilation Guide}.
