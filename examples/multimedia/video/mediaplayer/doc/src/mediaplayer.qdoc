    \brief Playing audio and video using the QML \c MediaPlayer type.

    This example demonstrates a simple multimedia player that can play
    audio and video files using various codecs.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 Instantiating the MediaPlayer
    The entry point for the QML code in this example is \c Main.qml. Here
    an \c ApplicationWindow is created and properties such as the \c id, \c title,
    \c width and \c height are set.

    \snippet video/mediaplayer/Main.qml 0

    Next the \c MediaPlayer is created and the two properties that are responsible for the video and
    audio output are defined.
    Firstly, \c videoOutput which renders the video viewfinder and secondly \c audioOutput which provides
    the audio output for the player.

    \snippet video/mediaplayer/Main.qml 1
    \dots
    \snippet video/mediaplayer/Main.qml 2
    \dots
    \snippet video/mediaplayer/Main.qml 3

    The \c visible property of the \c VideoOutput type is set to \c true when the \c mediaStatus
    property of the \c MediaPlayer is greater than 0. \c mediaStatus is of enumeration type
    and is equal to 0 when \e {No media has been set}, and greater than 0 otherwise. Therefore,
    the \c VideoOutput is visible when media has been set.

    The \c MediaPlayer type has a signal property called \c onErrorOccurred that can be
    overridden specifically to handle errors. In this case the signal opens a \c MessageDialog using
    the method \c {open()} and sets its \c text property to a \c MediaPlayer property called
    \c errorString.

    \snippet video/mediaplayer/Main.qml 4

    \section1 Playback Controls

    In order to have a useable media player, there needs to be an interface to control the playback.
    This is created in its own component file, \c PlaybackControl.qml, and instantiated in
    \c Main.qml.

    \snippet video/mediaplayer/Main.qml 5
    \dots
    \snippet video/mediaplayer/Main.qml 6

    When created, objects are forwarded to this type such as track information,
    metadata information and the \c MediaPlayer object itself. In \c PlaybackControl.qml,
    each one of these objects have a \c {required property}, meaning that these properties must
    be set when the \c PlaybackControl object is created.

    \snippet video/mediaplayer/controls/PlaybackControl.qml 0

    These playback controls can be broken down into sections. In the top left of the panel lies
    a collection of buttons used to open a file, either by selecting a file from a file explorer or
    entering a URL. The file is loaded into the \c MediaPlayer by setting the \c source property.
    Both buttons are instantiated using a \c CustomButton \c {custom component}.

    \snippet video/mediaplayer/controls/PlaybackControl.qml 1

    Three buttons are created and centered on this panel, handling play, pause and seeking ten
    seconds backwards or forwards. The media is played and paused using the methods \c {play()}
    and \c {pause()}, respectively. To know when to draw a play or pause button, the \c playbackState
    property is queried. For example, when it is equal to the enum value \c MediaPlayer.PlayingState
    then the pause button is drawn.

    \snippet video/mediaplayer/controls/PlaybackControl.qml 2

    To navigate ten seconds forward or backwards, the \c position of the \c MediaPlayer type is
    incremented by 10,000 milliseconds and set using the method \c {setPosition()}.

    \snippet video/mediaplayer/controls/PlaybackControl.qml 3

    \section1 Playback Seeking and Audio

    In \c {PlaybackControl.qml}, an \c AudioControl and a \c PlaybackSeekControl type are instantiated.
    These are both defined in their own component file and are responsible for volume control and
    playback seeking, respectively. The \c AudioControl type defines a button to mute and a \c Slider,
    from \c {QtQuick Controls}, to set the volume of the player. Both of these attributes are exposed by
    defining a \c mute and \c volume property and are accessed from the \c AudioOutput definition in
    \c {Main.qml}.

    \snippet video/mediaplayer/controls/AudioControl.qml 0

    The \c PlaybackSeekControl uses a \c RowLayout containing a \c Slider with a \c Text item either side.
    The two \c Text items display the current time and the remaining time of the media being played. These
    are both calculated using two properties of the \c MediaPlayer type, \c {position}, which gives the
    current playback position in milliseconds, and \c {duration}, which gives the duration of the media
    in milliseconds.

    \snippet video/mediaplayer/controls/PlaybackSeekControl.qml 0
    \dots
    \snippet video/mediaplayer/controls/PlaybackSeekControl.qml 1

    The \c Slider is only enabled when the media player is seekable and not, for example, live media.
    The \c MediaPlayer type has a property for this called \c seekable. The \c value of the \c Slider
    is calculated using the \c position and \c duration properties of the \c MediaPlayer.

    \snippet video/mediaplayer/controls/PlaybackSeekControl.qml 2

    \section1 Metadata and Track Information

    The \c PlaybackControl type instantiates a \c SettingsPopup, which contains information about the
    metadata of the currently loaded media and track selection, as well as the ability to update the
    playback rate. This \c Popup is defined in \c SettingsPopup.qml.

    \image settings.png

    The metadata is contained in its own component file, \c MetadataInfo.qml. It contains a \c ListModel,
    a function to clear it, \c {clear()}, and a function to populate it, \c {read(MediaMetadata metadata)}.
    The \c {read(MediaMetadata metadata)} function takes as a parameter an object of type \c MediaMetaData,
    and navigates its key-value structure to extract its data into the \c model of the \c {ListView}. The
    methods used to do this are \c {keys()}, which returns all the keys of the \c MediaMetaData, and
    {stringValue(Key key)}, which returns the \c value for a given \c key.

    \snippet video/mediaplayer/controls/MetadataInfo.qml 0

    The data is then displayed in \c {SettingsPopup.qml} in a \c ListView type. The \c delegate of this
    \c ListView is a row of two \c Text items, corresponding to the key-value pairs abstracted from the
    \c MediaMetaData item.

    On the other side of the \c Popup there is playback rate controls and track selection for audio, video and
    subtitles. The playback rate is chosen from a \c ComboBox and set using the property \c playbackRate.

    \snippet video/mediaplayer/controls/SettingsPopup.qml 0

    The type called \c TracksInfo, defined in \c {TracksInfo.qml}, contains the data about the tracks.
    More specifically, a \c ListModel containing the titles of the tracks, or for subtitles specifically, the
    langauges. This information is populated in \c Main.qml by calling the \c {read(MediaMetadata mediaMetadata)}
    function defined in the \c TracksInfo type.

    \snippet video/mediaplayer/Main.qml 6

    The \c model defined in \c TracksInfo is then queried in the \c {ComboBox}es in the
    \c SettingsPopup to select the current track.
