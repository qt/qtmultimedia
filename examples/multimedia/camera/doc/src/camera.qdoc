\brief Shows how to capture a still image or record video.

\image camera-example.png

The Camera Example demonstrates how you can use \l{Qt Multimedia} to implement
some basic Camera functionality to take still images and record video clips
with audio.

\include examples-run.qdocinc

The example implements a \c Camera class that acts as our camera interface. It
has a user interface, control functions, setting values and a means of defining
the location where the image or video clip is to be saved. It will also store
the image and video settings.

The Camera class uses:
\list
    \li An instance of \l {QCamera}, the API class interface to the hardware.
    \li An instance of \l {QImageCapture} to take still images.
    \li An instance of \l {QMediaRecorder} to record video. It also contains
    the user interface object.
\endlist

\section1 The Camera constructor

The Camera constructor does some basic initialization of the user interface
including disabling all buttons by default.

\quotefromfile camera/camera.cpp
\skipto Camera::Camera()
\printuntil ui->metaDataButton->setEnabled(false);

It seeks permissions for input device access:

\skipto #if QT_CONFIG(permissions)
\printuntil #endif

Inputs are assigned:
\printuntil updateCameras()

 UI signals are connected to slots that react to the triggering event:
\printuntil setCamera(QMediaDevices::defaultVideoInput());

However, most of the work is done when the \e{setCamera()} function is called,
passing in a \l QCameraDevice.

\section1 setCamera()

\c{setCamera()} sets up various connections between the user interface and the
functionality of the Camera class using signals and slots. It also instantiates
and initializes the \l {QCamera}, \l {QImageCapture}, and \l {QMediaRecorder}
objects.

\skipto void Camera::setCamera(const QCameraDevice &cameraDevice)
\printto m_captureSession.setVideoOutput(ui->viewfinder);

The still and video recording visual tabs are enabled:

\printuntil updateCaptureMode();

Finally the \l {QCamera::start}{start()} function of the \l{QCamera}
object is called.

\printuntil m_camera->start();

\section1 Triggering capturing

Now that the camera is ready for user commands it waits for a suitable event.
Such an event can be a key press of either the \l {Qt::Key_CameraFocus} or
\l {Qt::Key_Camera} buttons on the application window.

Key_CameraFocus will simply display the preview and lock the camera settings.
\printto case Qt::Key_Camera:

\c Key_Camera will either call \e{takeImage()} if doing an image capture, or call
\c record() or \c stop() (if already recording) on the QMediaRecorder instance
when recording video.

\printuntil break;
